+++

However convinced you are with Puppet, scrapping  your existing automation tool  overnight for a shiny new tool may have  unknown risks attached. More over, it may could  be challenging  to get a buy in from your management to invest in time, money and resources to implement a new solution without showing them the value.

With puppet, you could take a iterative approach towards automation. You could start with a single application, or even a single entity such as a system user to manage. Once you see the value, show it to all stake holders, get a buy in and move to the next application, one at a time.
